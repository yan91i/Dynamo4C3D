# Transfer Object Layers

Transfer Object Layers provides comprehensive functionality to transfer Civil 3D object layer settings between projects, including direct file transfer and Excel export/import capabilities for creating and managing standards.

## Overview

Transfer Object Layers allows you to:
- Import object layer data from multiple sources
- Edit and modify data before transferring
- Export current file settings as standards
- Create and manage standards efficiently
- Share standards across teams


## Import Options

Transfer Object Layers provides three main ways to import object layer data:

### 1. Import from Open File

Import object layer data from currently open Civil 3D files:

- **File Selection** - Select from currently open Civil 3D files
- **Direct Import** - Import object layer data directly from open files

### 2. Import from Closed File

Import object layer data from closed Civil 3D files:

- **File Browser** - Browse and select closed Civil 3D files
- **Data Extraction** - Extract object layer data from closed files
- **Offline Import** - Import data without opening the source file

### 3. Import from Excel

Import object layer data from Excel files containing standards:

- **Excel File Selection** - Select Excel files containing object layer data
- **File Validation** - Validate Excel file format and content

## Modify Data Before Transferring

Transfer Object Layers provides data editing capabilities, allowing you to modify object layer data directly in the UI before transferring to your target file.

### Imported Data Display

View all imported object layer data:

Imported object layer data is displayed in a structured table with four main columns:

- Layer
- Modifier 
- Value 
- Locked 

This layout allows you to easily review and understand each object’s layer configuration before proceeding with transfer.



### Direct Editing

After importing object layer data, you can edit the data directly in the UI before transferring to your target file.

## Export to Excel

Transfer Object Layers provides Excel export functionality with two main export options to create and manage standards.

### Export Options

Choose from two export sources:

#### 1. Export Active UI Data

Export the currently displayed and edited data from the UI:

- **Current UI State** - Export data as it appears in the current UI table
- **Edited Data** - Include any modifications made in the data editing interface

#### 2. Export Open Active File

Export object layer data directly from the currently open Civil 3D file:

- **File-based Export** - Export data from the open Civil 3D file
- **Original Data** - Export original object layer settings without UI modifications
